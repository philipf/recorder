Offline Voice Recorder: Application Specification
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-07-27

1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a web application that allows users to record audio, store it locally on their device, and manage their recordings. The application is designed for simplicity and offline functionality, ensuring that all data is stored and accessible without a network connection. The primary use case is for capturing voice notes that may later be used for transcription.

2. Core Functionality & Technical Requirements
2.1. Recording
Audio Format: Recordings shall be captured and stored in the .webm format, utilizing the browser's native MediaRecorder API. This provides a good balance between audio quality and file size.

Recording Controls: The user must have the following controls:

Start: Initiates a new recording session.

Stop: Ends the current recording session and saves the file.

Pause: Temporarily halts the recording without terminating the session.

Resume: Continues a paused recording.

Visual Feedback: While a recording is active, the UI must clearly indicate the recording state.

An elapsed time counter shall be displayed, counting up from 00:00 in a MM:SS format.

2.2. Storage
Technology: All audio recordings and associated metadata shall be stored locally using the browser's IndexedDB API. This ensures full offline capability.

Data Persistence: Data must persist between browser sessions.

Auto-Deletion: A fixed, non-configurable rule shall be implemented to automatically delete any recording that is older than 10 days. This process should run automatically each time the application is loaded to maintain storage hygiene.

2.3. Platform
Type: Client-side Web Application.

Dependencies: The application should be built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). No external JavaScript libraries are required for the core recording and storage functionality.

3. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)
3.1. Main Layout
The application will have a single-page interface.

A main "Start Recording" button shall be positioned prominently at the top of the page, above the list of existing recordings.

3.2. Recording State UI
When the user clicks "Start Recording," the main button area will transform into the active recording control panel.

This panel will display:

The live elapsed time counter.

A "Pause" button (which toggles to "Resume").

A "Stop" button.

3.3. Recordings List
Display Area: All saved recordings will be listed below the main recording control area.

Empty State: If no recordings are saved, this area will display a user-friendly message, such as: "Your recordings will appear here."

List Item Details: Each item in the list represents a single recording and must display the following information:

Title: The name of the recording.

Duration: The total duration of the recording (e.g., 05:32).

Download Button: An icon or button to download the .webm file.

Delete Button: An icon or button to delete the recording.

Sorting: Recordings should be displayed in reverse chronological order, with the newest recording at the top of the list.

3.4. Interaction Details
Default Naming: When a new recording is saved, it will be assigned a default title in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Recording (e.g., 2025-07-27 17:23 - Recording). The time will use a 24-hour format.

Renaming a Recording: To rename a recording, the user will click directly on the title text. This action will convert the text into an editable input field. The change is saved when the user presses Enter or clicks away (blur event).

Deleting a Recording: When the user clicks the "Delete" button, a confirmation prompt (e.g., a simple modal dialog) must be shown to prevent accidental deletion. The prompt should ask, "Are you sure you want to delete this recording?".

4. Error Handling
The application must gracefully handle the following scenarios:

Browser Incompatibility: On load, check for MediaRecorder and IndexedDB support. If either is unavailable, display a message informing the user that their browser is not supported.

Microphone Permissions: If the user denies microphone access when prompted by the browser, the application should display a clear message explaining that microphone access is required to make a recording. The app should not be in a broken state.

Storage Errors: Handle potential IndexedDB errors, such as the user's storage quota being exceeded. Inform the user if a recording cannot be saved.

5. Testing Plan
5.1. Key User Scenarios for Acceptance Testing
Scenario 1: First-Time Use

Open the app.

Verify the "Start Recording" button is visible.

Verify the "Your recordings will appear here" message is displayed.

Scenario 2: Create a Recording

Click "Start Recording."

Grant microphone permissions.

Verify the timer starts counting up.

Speak for 10 seconds.

Click "Stop."

Verify a new item appears in the list with the correct default title and duration.

Scenario 3: Pause/Resume Functionality

Start a new recording.

After 5 seconds, click "Pause."

Verify the timer stops.

After a few moments, click "Resume."

Verify the timer continues from where it left off.

Stop the recording and verify it is saved correctly.

Scenario 4: Manage Recordings

Rename: Click on a recording's title, change the name, and press Enter. Verify the title is updated.

Download: Click the download button and verify the .webm file is downloaded.

Delete: Click the delete button, confirm the action, and verify the recording is removed from the list.

Scenario 5: Auto-Deletion Logic

(Requires manual testing by manipulating system time or the 'date created' value in IndexedDB).

Create a recording and modify its creation date to be 11 days in the past.

Reload the application.

Verify the old recording has been automatically deleted.
